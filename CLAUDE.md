Guidance for Claude Code working on this repository.

## Mission in one line

GeckoView-based Android browser whose only "killer feature" is **uBlock Origin running silently under the hood**. Treat the extensions system as an implementation detail, not a user-facing feature.

## Stack snapshot

- **Engine**: GeckoView (Firefox), pulled transitively via `org.mozilla.components:browser-engine-gecko`
- **Frameworks**: Mozilla android-components 150.0.2 — pinned in [app/build.gradle.kts](app/build.gradle.kts) via `androidComponentsVersion`. **Every `org.mozilla.components:*` artifact must use the same version**, mismatches give cryptic linker errors at runtime.
- **AdBlock**: uBlock Origin (Mozilla-signed XPI from AMO, fetched at first launch)
- **Language**: Kotlin 2.0, Java 17 toolchain, AGP 8.7
- **min/target SDK**: 26 / 35
- **UI**: View system + ViewBinding (Compose later)

## Cardinal rules

1. **Never bypass `BrowserComponents`.** `GeckoRuntime` *must* be created exactly once per process; making a second one will silently break things or crash. If you need engine state from anywhere, route it through `(application as BrowserApplication).components`.

2. **Don't downgrade tracking protection.** `BrowserComponents.engine` defaults to `TrackingProtectionPolicy.recommended()` — uBO sits *on top* of that. Don't disable it for "compatibility" without a measured reason.

3. **uBO is not optional, but is invisible.** No "extensions" UI in the app menu. The only knob the user gets is enable/disable AdBlock. If you add a settings screen, hide all WebExtension management behind a dev-mode flag for now.

4. **Pin `androidComponentsVersion` together.** Bumping a single dependency by hand will pull a different transitive `geckoview-stable` and you'll spend hours debugging native-code crashes. Update the `val` in `app/build.gradle.kts` and verify all `org.mozilla.components:*` artifacts at https://maven.mozilla.org/maven2/org/mozilla/components/.

5. **Don't bundle the XPI in `assets/`.** The current strategy is to install from the AMO URL at runtime so updates are automatic and the APK stays small. If you switch to a bundled XPI, document why and use `installBuiltInWebExtension` (privileged path) — but you lose auto-updates.

## Critical: uBO install requires a `WebExtensionDelegate`

**Never** call `engine.installWebExtension(uboUrl, …)` without first calling `engine.registerWebExtensionDelegate(…)`. GeckoView raises a permission prompt on install (uBO needs `<all_urls>`, `tabs`, `webNavigation`, etc.) — without a delegate to answer it, the prompt is `AbortError`'d via `Actor 'GeckoViewPermission' destroyed before query 'GeckoView:ContentPermission' was resolved`. The install **silently succeeds** but uBO comes up half-crippled: filters mostly work, but cosmetic + popup + anti-circumvention rules don't.

[AdblockBootstrap.registerAutoGrantDelegate()](app/src/main/java/com/upgrid/browser/addons/AdblockBootstrap.kt) registers the delegate. The signature in a-c 150.x is:

```kotlin
override fun onInstallPermissionRequest(
    extension: WebExtension,
    permissions: List<String>,
    origins: List<String>,
    dataCollectionPermissions: List<String>,
    onConfirm: (PermissionPromptResponse) -> Unit,
)
```

`PermissionPromptResponse(isPermissionsGranted, isPrivateModeGranted, isTechnicalAndInteractionDataGranted)` — grant **all three** for uBO; tech/interaction-data is needed for anti-circumvention rules and private-mode for filtering in incognito tabs.

We auto-grant **only for our pinned UBO_ID**; anything else falls through to the engine's default deny.

## Critical: `AdblockController.isEnabled()` is suspend, never call from observer

`Engine.listInstalledWebExtensions(…)` is a callback API. The callback **does not** always fire synchronously — on cold start the engine cache is cold and the callback lands on the next dispatch tick. A sync `isEnabled()` that reads `var result = false` before the callback fires returns `false` even when uBO is installed and active — symptom: bottom-bar shield permanently rendered OFF.

The fix is `suspend fun isEnabled(): Boolean = findUbo()?.isEnabled() == true`. **Don't** call it from `store.flow().collect { … renderAdblockShield() }` — store ticks fire dozens of times during page load, each launches a new lookup coroutine, the engine queue backs up, main thread stalls, **ANR**. Refresh shield only at: `wireBottomBar()` init, after the user's own shield tap, after `AppMenuPopup` toggles uBO (popup calls back via `activity.renderAdblockShield()`), and `onResume()`.

## API gotchas (these break between a-c versions)

The `Engine` callbacks have shifted between releases. Current expected signatures (a-c 150.x):

```kotlin
fun installWebExtension(
    url: String,
    onSuccess: ((WebExtension) -> Unit) = { },
    onError: ((Throwable) -> Unit) = { _ -> }
): CancellableOperation

fun listInstalledWebExtensions(
    onSuccess: ((List<WebExtension>) -> Unit) = { },
    onError: ((Throwable) -> Unit) = { _ -> }
)
```

If a build breaks at `AdblockBootstrap` with a callback-shape error, **first** check the Engine.kt in the matching a-c version on https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/android-components/components/concept/engine/src/main/java/mozilla/components/concept/engine/Engine.kt — older versions used `(id, url, onSuccess, onError(String, Throwable))`.

## Bumping uBlock Origin

`AdblockBootstrap.UBO_XPI_URL` is pinned. To bump:

1. Open https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/ in any Firefox.
2. DevTools → Network → click "Add to Firefox" → copy the final `.xpi` URL.
3. Replace `UBO_XPI_URL`. Bump `versionCode` of the app so existing installs re-trigger the bootstrap (which is a no-op if uBO is already installed at any version — GeckoView updates extensions on its own schedule).

The AMO file id changes per release; the version in the filename is cosmetic.

## Roadmap (don't merge work that violates phase ordering without discussion)

- **Phase 1 — MVP.** Single session, omnibar, silent uBO. **Done.**
- **Phase 2 — Tabs + persistence.** `BrowserStore`-driven; `BrowserToolbar`; `SessionFeature`/`ToolbarFeature`; bottom-sheet tabs tray; `SessionStorage` autosave/restore; AdBlock on/off in app menu. **Done.**
- **Phase 3 — History & bookmarks.** `browser-storage-sync` (Places-backed) for history + bookmarks; downloads via `feature-downloads`.
- **Phase 4 — Settings.** Theme picker, search engine, default-browser prompt, "use system dark mode", about-page. Move the AdBlock toggle from popup menu into the settings screen.
- **Phase 5 — Optional extensions.** Surface a curated list (Dark Reader, Bitwarden, Tampermonkey) via `feature-addons`'s `AddonManager`. Behind a "Power user" setting.

## Architecture notes (phase 2)

- **`BrowserStore` is the single source of truth.** Tabs, selected tab id, URL, title, progress all live there. UI observes via `store.flow()` and dispatches actions; never mutate engine sessions directly.
- **Features are the glue.** `SessionFeature` renders the selected tab into `GeckoEngineView`; `ToolbarFeature` keeps `BrowserToolbar` synced. Both are bound through `ViewBoundFeatureWrapper` so they stop/start with the view lifecycle.
- **`BrowserApplication.restorePreviousSession`** restores tabs *before* the bootstrap installs uBO — this guarantees tabs are visible the moment the user sees the activity even if AMO is unreachable.
- **Tab close → empty state:** `MainActivity.wireBackPress` finishes the activity when the last tab is closed via the system back button. The tabs tray itself does *not* auto-dismiss when `tabs.isEmpty()` — it shows a Banana-style empty illustration. If the user swipes the tray away with zero tabs, `TabsTrayFragment.onDismiss` opens a fresh HOME tab so MainActivity isn't left empty-handed.
- **App menu is a `PopupWindow`, not a BottomSheet.** [AppMenuPopup](app/src/main/java/com/upgrid/browser/menu/AppMenuPopup.kt) is a 300dp drop-down anchored to `btnMenu` via `showAsDropDown(anchor, 0, 0, Gravity.END)`. The auto-flip-above behavior places it correctly even though the anchor is at the bottom of the screen. Construct a new instance per tap (cheap, avoids stale toggle state).

## Testing notes

- **Real device > emulator** for GeckoView. The emulator x86_64 image works but is slow; many ad-blocker quirks only repro on real Chromium-vs-Firefox sites.
- Verify uBO is alive: load `https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock` — it scores blocked items. Expected: 90+%.
- After bumping a-c version, smoke-test by loading youtube.com (cosmetic filtering), facebook.com (anti-circumvention), and a major news site.

## Sharing screenshots with Claude

UI work on this project goes screenshot ↔ feedback. **Anthropic's API rejects multi-image chats when any image exceeds 2000 px on any side**, and Android phones produce 1080×2400 screenshots — they trip the limit and corrupt the whole conversation.

**Workflow:**
1. Drop raw screenshots into [screenshots/](screenshots/) (descriptive names: `home-dark.png`, `tabs-tray-empty.png`).
2. Run [tools/Resize-Screenshots.ps1](tools/Resize-Screenshots.ps1) — downsizes anything >1900 px to fit, in-place, preserving aspect ratio.
3. Drag the resized files into the chat.

If Claude is asked to review UI and the user pastes a fresh phone screenshot, **first** point them at this workflow before the chat is at risk. Don't dump screenshots into the project root — they end up unowned junk and pollute Glob results.

## Design direction

The product target is **Banana Browser** (Google Play) — minimal chrome, big tap targets, single-purpose menu sheet, no power-user clutter. Not Firefox-for-Android, not Chrome. The "uBO is invisible" rule above is part of the same philosophy: hide complexity, surface one toggle. Don't add Firefox-style settings depth.

## Build issues cheat sheet

- "Could not find org.mozilla.components:..." → confirm `maven("https://maven.mozilla.org/maven2/")` in `settings.gradle.kts` `dependencyResolutionManagement`.
- "Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: ... libxul.so" → ABI filter mismatch; ensure your test device's ABI is in `splits.abi.include` in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
- "GeckoRuntime already running" / second-runtime crash → something created a `GeckoRuntime` outside `BrowserComponents`. Search the codebase for `GeckoRuntime.create`.
- IDE shows red on `mozilla.components.*` → invalidate caches; the Mozilla maven host is occasionally slow on first sync, which leaves an incomplete index.
